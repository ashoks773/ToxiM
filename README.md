ToxiM: A Toxicity Prediction Tool for Small Molecules

ToxiM is a machine-learning based binary classifier for the prediction of toxicity of molecules. Regression models for CaCo-2 permeability and Aqueous solubility has been provided to support the predicted toxicity for a given molecule. For the batch processing please download standalone version of ToxiM from Dataset page.
